# Pokemon Top Trumps Game

**Python | Pytest**

After completing CodeFirstGirls Python Kickstarter course, I created a Top Trumps Pokemon game for two players that runs on the command line, requesting data from the PokeAPI.

### To run the game:

1. Launch your environment e.g.

```
$ Pipenv shell
```

2. Install dependencies listed in the pipfile (using Pip or Pipenv) e.g.

```
$ Pipenv install
```

3. Run the game on the command line:

```
$ python3 game.py
```

### To run the tests:

After installing project dependencies as in the above instructions (using pip or pipenv)

```
$ Pytest

```
